Refactory is an app that uses OpenAI's chat API to refactor code.

The user needs to have an OpenAI API key to access the application. The user can enter code, choose the programming language, select some 
attributes they want the refactored code to have, and optionally add some additional instructions. The app then constructs and prompt and
requests a response from the OpenAI API.
